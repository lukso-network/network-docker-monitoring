# LUKSO CLI monitoring &middot; [![PR Welcome Badge](https://badgen.net/https/pr-welcome-badge.vercel.app/api/badge/Hugoo/lukso-cli-monitoring)](https://github.com/Hugoo/lukso-cli-monitoring/issues?q=archived:false+is:issue+is:open+sort:updated-desc+label%3A%22help%20wanted%22%2C%22good%20first%20issue%22)

This repo provides a simple example of docker configuration to monitor a LUKSO node using the [LUKSO CLI](https://github.com/lukso-network/tools-lukso-cli). Depending on your configuration, you might need to adjust it. For instance, if you run the LUKSO CLI on a remote node with no GUI, you might need to use [SSH port-forwarding](https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/115906) to view the dashboards.
